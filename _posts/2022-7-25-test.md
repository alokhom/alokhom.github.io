Migrate from Cassandra in a vanilla STS to K8ssandra
----------------------------------------------------

Most users of k8ssandra have either started a new Cassandra cluster or have migrated from an existing Cassandra cluster. 

In non containerized Cassandra clustrers like the vanilla STS Cassandra cluster, there is no earlier backups made or some users are stuck in a risk-mitigation situation if the k8ssandra migration would be pretty straight forward and flawless. 

The Risk is what if the migration is not a success ? And what is the fallback plan migrating from a STS cluster.

There is no documented resources on the internet and I have tried to attempt a solution with this repo and it works.
