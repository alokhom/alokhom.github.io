Migrate from Cassandra in a vanilla STS to K8ssandra
----------------------------------------------------

Most users of k8ssandra have either started a new Cassandra cluster or have migrated from an existing Cassandra cluster. 

In containerized Cassandra clusters like the vanilla STS Cassandra cluster, there is no earlier backups made perhaps or some users are stuck in a assumption that the k8ssandra migration is straight forward and flawless. 

The Risk is what if the migration is not a success ? And what is the fallback plan migrating from a STS cluster. 

There is no documented resources on the internet and I have tried to attempt a solution with this repo and it kind of works.
